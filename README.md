# Nicson's Uber Clone
An ongoing project solely to enrich my knowledge of React Native


## Features

- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Use the Google Distance Matrix API to calculate Travel Time, Distance, and cost
- Use the Directions Google API for real navigation
- Use the Google Places API for real navigation
- Use Apple maps for iOS 
- Use React Native Navigation to navigate between screens
- Use React Native Elements for app design


## Installation

- Install Expo

```bash
  npm install -g expo-cli
  
  expo init "projectname"
```

- Install Redux toolkit
```bash
# Yarn
  yarn add @reduxjs/toolkit
```
- Install React Navigation Stack
```bash
yarn add react-navigation-stack @react-native-community/masked-view
```
- Install Google Places Auto Complete
```bash
  yarn add react-native-google-places-autocomplete
```
- Install Dotenv
```bash
  yarn add react-native-dotenv
```
- Install Tailwind CSS
```bash
  yarn add tailwind-react-native-classnames

## Deployment

To run this project
```bash
  expo start
```

This  will open MetroBundler on your web browser

- Select "Tunnel" for direct testing on your mobile device

- Install and Open "Expo Go" application on your mobile OS device
From this point, you could use QR codes and run the application on your mobile device

Furthermore, for smoother workflow, run this command
```bash
  expo publish
```
By doing so, it allows me to review my work faster through Expo Projects, instead of constantly using QR codes
(You have to setup an Expo account in order to do this)
